# KMS-Analysis
My first SQL project while taking Data Analytics classes with Incubator hub

## Project Topic: KMS Sales and performance Analysis 

### Project Overview
This project was aimed to generate insights into the sales performance of Kultra Mega Stores, as well as their customer database. By analyzing the data, I was able to gather enough insights to present your key findings.

#### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here was generated using the sales data of a megastore

#### Tools Used
- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)

#### Data Preparation
In the initial phase of loading the data, missing values were handled, and some data types were changed

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA invloved exploring the data in order to answer some questions about the data such as:
- The shipping method which incurred the most shipping cost
- The small business customer had the highest sales, and a lot more
